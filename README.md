MlCOFSyn is a machine learning framework designed to assist in the synthesis of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs). MlCOFSyn leverages efficient machine learning algorithms and features an intuitive graphical interface, enabling it to be run on consumer-grade computers by non-experts. The MlCOFSyn framework currently integrates the NEgen1o model as the computational engine and has the following functionalities:

1. ​**Prediction**​: Predicts the crystal size distributions based on the input monomer addition sequence.
2. ​**Design**​: Reverse-engineer the required monomer addition sequence for the target crystal size.
3. ​**Optimization**​: Optimizes the monomer addition sequence to produce larger crystals.

## Installation
1.You can clone the repository by running the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/studentgpt/MlCOFSyn.git
```

2.The required libraries can be installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Requirements for running MlCOFSyn
### Python Libraries
The following Python libraries must be installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- joblib
- psutil

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows  
- **CPU**: A minimum of 6 CPU cores is required.
- **C++ Version**: `C++ >= 8.1.0` must be installed.

## Instructions for running MlCOFSyn


### **1.Prediction Task**
**1.1 Run the following command to launch the the NEgen1o Graphical User Interface (GUI):** 
```bash
cd MlCOFSyn\prediction
```
```bash
python NEgen1_start.py
```


After starting up the GUI, you will see the **`System and Parameters`** Panel:

- **`Set COF Parameters`** Button: Click this button to set the parameters for the 2D COF, which can be determined through experimental measurements and reaction pathway analysis<sup>[1][2]</sup>.Default parameters are for COF-5.

- The **Initial System** Section: This section allows the user to define the initial conditions of the system, such as the initial volume, initial nuclei concentration, diameter, and height.

- The **Conditions to Add Monomer** Section: In this section, the user can input the **Monomer (core unit) Concentration** and the **Monomer Addition Sequence**. The latter is a list of the monomer volume added at each time (in L; **assuming core and linker monomers are already combined in solution before addition into the system**). Note that the NEgen1o model works under stoichiometric monomer ratios thus **only the concentration of the core monomer is needed for input**.

- Once the **Monomer Addition Sequence** is entered, you may click the `Check Input` button to check the **Number of Additions** and the **Total Volume to Add**.

The **monomer addition sequence** is a numeral list separated by commas. Examples include:

* `0.019,0.037,0.055,0.073,0.091,0.109,0.127,0.145,0.163,0.181` represents an increasing-rate addition sequence

* `1` represents a single addition (add all monomers at once)

**1.2  `Run Computational Engine` panel:**

In this panel, you can start the calculation by clicking the `Run` button to execute the NEgen1o model, which is currently supported in MlCOFSyn. You can view detailed output information in the panel in real-time.

🚨 **Based on the input monomer addition sequence, a `nuc__1_0_x`(where x represents the number of additions in a monomer addition sequence) file will be automatically generated MlCOFSyn\negen1o directory. Remove this file before inputing a different monomer addition sequence in a new Prediction task.**

**1.3 By clicking `Get Result Summary` Button in the `Post Processing` Panel section, the user can view the results including the final crystal distribution.**

### **2.Optimization Task**

**2.1 Run the following command to launch the Bayesian optimization interface:**
   ```bash
   cd MlCOFSyn\optimization
   ```
   ```bash
   python main_ui_optimization.py
   ```

**2.2** After launching the program, you will enter the **Bayesian Optimization GUI**. The user can modify the material parameters by clicking the **`Set COF parameters`** button.

**2.3** Set the parameters for monomer addition:

  1. The core monomer concentration can be typed in the **Monomer Concentration** window.

  2. **Load Monomer Addition Sequence Space File:**
     Upload the file containing the monomer addition sequence space to be optimized. This file is in CSV format with the following format:
  ```bash
     r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8,r9,r10,r11,r12,r13,r14,r15,r16,r17,r18,r19,r20
  
     0.062,0.109,0.082,0.025,0.165,0.147,0.131,0.146,0.102,0.031,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
  
     0.031,0.036,0.07,0.054,0.021,0.086,0.027,0.012,0.092,0.013,0.089,0.075,0.028,0.028,0.088,0.071,0.076,0.019,0.022,0.062

   ```
  - The first row indicates the addition times.
  - The remaining rows represent all specified monomer addition sequences.
  - You can find data examples in the file: `MlCOFSyn\optimization\space\all_space.csv`
  - **All monomer addition sequences in the `reaction_space.csv` must have the same number of length** (use 0 to fill empty additions).
  
  2. **Stop Conditions**:  
  - Input the **Maximum Number of Iterations**.  
  - Specify the **No-Improvement Criterion** as a stop condition.  
  
  3. **Start the Optimization**:  
     Once the **monomer addition sequence space file** is loaded and the **stop conditions** are set, click the **`Start Bayesian Optimization`** button to run the program.

The **Maximum Q value** and its corresponding **monomer addition sequence** will be displayed, and all other results will be saved to `optimization/result.csv`.

## A brief description of the theory

The NEgen1 model<sup>[3]</sup> was derived from kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results. This model takes six parameters for the 2D COF and those for COF-5 are used as default as provided in the code.<sup>[3][4]</sup>Methods to derive the parameters for the other 2D COFs can be found in literature.<sup>[1][2]</sup> The NEgen1o model is optimized upon the NEgen1 model for efficiency while not affecting accuracy.<sup>[5]</sup>

The prediction task is performed by directly running the computational engine (currently the NEgen1o model). The optimization task leverages Bayesian algorithm.<sup>[6]</sup> The design task utilize the MeanBAX<sup>[7]</sup> as the acquisition function.
